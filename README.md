# Portfolio Projects

The purpose of this project is to create a WordPress plugin that can handle some of the Project Management and display requirements of a portfolio.

The plugin will allow the admin to keep track of the various requirements, scope, and schedule of a project. It will also be helpful for resource management. This will all be controlled as part of the backend in WordPress.

The plugin will also serve a lot of this information to the frontend as part of the portfolio to display work, current project status, and various updates.
